# foundation

Foundation is a foundation to build mods on.

## New cvars

* g_noSelfDamage <0|1> : default to 0. Toggle the player self damages
* g_startAmmo*X* <0|200> : allow to define the amount of ammunitions for a weapon. *X* can be MG, SG, GL, RL, LG, RG, PG, BFG, NG, PL, CG
* g_startArmor <0|200> : allow to define the amount of armor at spawn
* g_startHealth <0|200> : allow to define the amount of health at spawn
* g_ammoRespawn <seconds> : ammo respawn times for FFA and Duel
* g_ammoTeamRespawn <seconds> : ammo respawn times for team gametypes
* g_armorRespawn <seconds> : armor respawn times for FFA and Duel
* g_armorTeamRespawn <seconds> : armor respawn times for team gametypes
* g_healthRespawn <seconds> : health respawn times for FFA and Duel
* g_healthTeamRespawn <seconds> : health respawn times for team gametypes
* g_megahealthRespawn <seconds> : megahealth respawn times for FFA and Duel
* g_megahealthTeamRespawn <seconds> : megahealth respawn times for team gametypes
* g_powerupRespawn <seconds> : powerup respawn times for FFA and Duel
* g_powerupTeamRespawn <seconds> : powerup respawn times for team gametypes
* g_holdableRespawn <seconds> : holdable respawn times for FFA and Duel
* g_holdableTeamRespawn <seconds> : holdable respawn times for team gametypes

### Flagged cvars

The following cvars use a "flag" value which acts as a combination of integers to specify a group of items:

* wpflags "VAL" : what weapons a player should have at spawn.
  
The corresponding values are:

* Machinegun	1
* Shotgun	2
* Grenade Launcher	4
* Rocket Launcher	8
* Lightning Gun	16
* Railgun	32
* Plasma Gun	64
* BFG10K	128
* Nailgun	256
* Prox Launcher	512
* Chaingun	1024

So, in order to let a player starts with a shotgun, a grenade launcher and a rocket launcher you can use "wpflags 14" (for 14 is 2+4+8). Note that players always start with the machinegun and the gauntlet.

The **removeX** cvars allow to choose to remove items from a map, **X** is either **ammo**, **item**, **powerup** or **weapon**:

* removeammo "VAL" use the same numbers as wpflags but for the corresponding ammunition
* removeeapon "VAL" use the same numbers as wpflags
* removeitem "VAL", where VAL can used the following values:
  * item_armor_shard 1
  * item_armor_combat 2
  * item_armor_body 4
  * item_health_small 8
  * item_health 16
  * item_health_large 32
  * item_health_mega 64
  * holdable_teleporter 128
  * holdable_medkit 256
 * removepowerup "VAL", where VAL can used the following values:
  * item_quad 1
  * item_enviro 2
  * item_haste 4
  * item_invis 8
  * item_regen 16
  * item_flight 32
